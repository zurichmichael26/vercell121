                The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places. Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth. Such poems as song of myself, a paean to individuality, and i sing the body electric, an homage to the human form, remain milestones in the development of american verse.
    </p>

    <h3>A poem for myself etheridge knight.</h3>
    <p>It is as long as ten odes. The lines reflect the difficult and impenetrable nature of certain the sections of song of myself approach one subject from several different angles. In 1855 the poem had no title, in 1856 it was called a poem of walt whitman an american and in 1860 it was changed to walt whitman. Such poems as song of myself, a paean to individuality, and i sing the body electric, an homage to the human form, remain milestones in the development of american verse.</p>

        <p>In some ways the sweeping momentum of the poem comes to an abrupt halt and lands in what philosophers call an aporia, or a troublesome conflict.</p>

        <p>Previous to that it had been titled poem of walt whitman, an american and, in the 1860, 1867, and 1871 editions, simply walt whitman. the poem&#039;s shifting title suggests something of what whitman was about in this piece.</p>
