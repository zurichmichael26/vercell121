                Poems awaken the dormant soul in us. Thanks to shashvat for correcting these lyrics. I was ready to go ready to leave i knew no one would miss me atleast that&#039;s what i believed.
    </p>

    <h3>Last christmas, i gave you my heart but the very next day, you gave it away this year, to save me from tears i&#039;ll give it to someone special.</h3>
    <p>A narrative poem, impersonally related, that was meant to be sung. I was ready to go ready to leave i knew no one would miss me atleast that&#039;s what i believed. I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny they are small, and the fountain is in france where you wrote me that last letter and i answered and never heard from you again. A heart that only fills with lust.</p>
