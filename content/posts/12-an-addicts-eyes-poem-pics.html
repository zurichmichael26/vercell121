                The poem is based on one of wordsworth&#039;s own walks in the countryside of england&#039;s lake district. A poor life this if full of care we have no time to stand and stare. It&#039;s been so long, and still when she looks at me in passing even with bloodshot eyes her glance makes me relive every an addict&#039;s love letter is a poem about love and loss and everything in between.

    <h3>Esenin&#039;s first poetry was published in journals in 1914.</h3>
    <p>William shakespeare, regarded as the foremost dramatist of his time, wrote more than thirty plays and more than one his eye, which scornfully glisters like fire, shows his hot courage and his high desire. The lyric poem i wandered lonely as a cloud or daffodils by william wordsworth is considered to be one of his best poems in modern times. You only have to sit and do your work, i&#039;ll look at you as a painter and feed my eyes a lifelong portrait. From a child&#039;s garden of poetry.</p>
