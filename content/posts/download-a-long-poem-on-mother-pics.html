                We all come at place, where we feel dejected and disenfranchised with this materialistic world, once in our lives. God made a wonderful mother a mother who doesn&#039;t grow old. Poems awaken the dormant soul in us.
    </p>

    <h3>And kisses me upon the face like mother, before bed.</h3>
    <p>My mother took me to the mall. The long poem is a literary genre including all poetry of considerable length. This poem is in the public domain. Whose providence we look forward, may our mother live long, to handle us like fawns.</p>
