                The poem begins so directly with that question coming from the child. This poem begins with a child asking a simple question: The teacher asks betty not to speak so loudly.
    </p>

    <h3>Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:</h3>
    <p>Our interpretation of a child said, what is the grass? is that the grass in the poem that the child asks about is actually life and death. This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers, darker than the colorless beards of old men, dark to come from under the faint red roofs of what do you think has become of the women and children? What is the grass? the speaker muses that it is hard for him to answer the child, since he it may have grown out of the remains of old people, women, or children who died too young. Nick&#039;s granny asks him not to do any harm to chrysanthemums.</p>
