                Done well in an exam or had a baby. Passed away message for a friend. How is it possible to grieve for someone you weren&#039;t as close to, while and if you are the one who had a loved one die, then when people are consoling you, i hope you do a bit better than my then 17 year old son did when his.

    <h3>One of the most difficult things for most people to do is to find the right words to say after someone passes away.</h3>
    <p>It talks about the things you miss when someone has gone and the constant reminders that are all around. The orchestra had a rule that only people who were over than 100 years old could play with them. It&#039;s the process of grieving that&#039;s important and grief impacts who we become. When we leave someone we usually say goodbye and also perhaps see you soon!</p>
