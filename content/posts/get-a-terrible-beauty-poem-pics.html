                Read chapter:1 from the story a terrible beauty by wandererzo with 191 reads. It is much more complicated than that. This excerpt from irish poet william butler yeats&#039; famous poem easter 1916 has the prominent oxymoron terrible beauty, which is despite the terrible things that happened and the many lives lost, yeats uses the term beauty to bring attention to the positive ideals of independence that gained.
    </p>

    <h3>But of course inclination does sometimes lurk in disinclination, no can mean yes, and suffering often does underlie beauty.</h3>
    <p>Yeats closes the poem by repeating the phrase a terrible beauty is born, which he&#039;s mentioned several times in the poem. The trauma of the great famine had left ireland with a fractured society and a culture on. The door was closed, sealing off my family from my and what about mine? This piece is part of the &#039;freedom&#039; exhibition, celebrating hang tough framing&#039;s 5 year anniversary, as well as commemorating the 1916 rising on which the theme is based.</p>
